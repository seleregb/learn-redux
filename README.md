# learn-redux
An implementation of React.js (^16.6.3) &amp; Redux.js

## Running

First `npm install` to grab all the necessary dependencies. 

Then run `npm start` and open <localhost:7770> in your browser.

## Production Build

Run `npm build` to create a distro folder and a bundle.js file.


## Note

The app has been considerably upgraded to make use of the latest stable version of react and dependent packages 
so you might find some differences in structure and code compared to that offered in Wes's [course](https://learnredux.com/), that is until there's an upgrade to the course material :smiley: :thumbsup:
